## A brief bio
I'm Ryan Hammon. I'm the President of SabinoDB, a data science and technology start-up focused on the retail and e-commerce space.

I didn’t get into technology through the traditional Silicon Valley path. I studied finance and business at Cal Poly and Wharton, and spent over 15 years in investment banking, private equity, and consulting — mostly as a generalist.

I've always been fascinated by how things work. Before anyone told me about the "five whys," I found myself doing this naturally since I was a boy. I’ve also never been the smartest guy in the room, but I’ve usually been the one willing to work the hardest.

In 2019, I was fortunate enough to become business partners with Bill Bass, the founder and brains behind SabinoDB.

I'm not your typical tech CEO or founder. My unconventional background gives me a unique perspective on how data and technology can solve important business problems and drive real impact on the bottom line.

I'm on GitHub to bridge my knowledge gap on the more technical aspects of my company, and I look forward to collaborating.
